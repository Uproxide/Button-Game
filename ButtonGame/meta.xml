A very simple Clicker Game, for the Wii! (also works on Wii Mini and vWii)

Pretty much a remake of my first wii game by the same name.

Press A to Select/Click, Up and Down on the D-Pad to Navigate Menus, and Left/Right on the D-Pad to Change Pages.

Thank you Cooper for testing and helping!</long_description>
